He won the NBA Slam Dunk Contests in 2002 and 2003, and also competed in the 2004 contest, but lost to Fred Jones in the finals. On June 28, 2007, Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats along with the draft rights to 36th pick Jermareo Davidson for the draft rights to eighth pick Brandan Wright. Richardson began to gain attention with the Bobcats when he led the team to a road win against the Boston Celtics after scoring 34 points. This was only the Celtics' fourth loss of\n\nSpud Webb in NBA history under six feet tall to win a slam dunk contest. Webb was a judge for the 2010 Dunk contest in Dallas, at the American Airlines Center. It was the first time the event has been in Dallas since Webb's win in 1986. Spud Webb Anthony Jerome \"Spud\" Webb (born July 13, 1963) is an American retired professional basketball point guard. Webb, who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA), is known for winning a Slam Dunk Contest despite being one of the shortest players in NBA history. NBA.com lists him at 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm)\n\nSlam Dunk Contest would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the Orlando Woolridge effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest. In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout. After a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest\n\nMichael Ponikvar line. The following year he won the same competition by jumping from the free throw line and dunking over a reporter from the St.Catharines standard. Overall, he was on many all-star teams and won several tournament MVP's in addition to being known as a dunk champion, who had early success as a member of championship central east team of the midget development league in Ontario. He helped his high school team win city championships in his last two years of high school as well as southern Ontario championships. He was selected to the Canadian Nike Basketball Camp that invited Canada's\n\nSlam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a \"Dunk Off\", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate Allen Iverson bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard,\n\nKobe Bryant in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion ever at the age of 18. Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in\n\nSlam Dunk Contest Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over Michael Jordan). Kenny Smith scored high points for originality with his signature dunk – he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. After 1990, interest in the Slam Dunk Contest began to wane and lasted throughout the 1990s. Initially, it was because many players lost interest in competing; some cited concerns of injuries, while others felt that the full repertoire of humanly possible dunks had already been exhausted. With\n\n2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game on March 30. The slam dunk contest included Kristine Anigwe, who was attempting to become the first girl to win the dunk contest since Candace Parker won the 2004 contest. Dwayne Bacon won the dunk contest against finalist Stephen Zimmerman with dunks that included a dunk over Jalen Rose who stood in front of the basket, while Anigwe failed to complete a dunk. Luke Kennard won the boys three-point shooting contest over finalists Jalen Brunson and Antonio Blakeney. Brunson won the boys Skills Competition over finalists Carlton Bragg and Isaiah Briscoe. Following the game, Thomas Bryant committed to Indiana on\n\nSlam Dunk Contest This was a season long event similar to 1977–1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (nearly one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Thompson, Alex English, Moses Malone, George Gervin, and Elvin Hayes and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. Darnell Hillman was named the winner that season, beating out the Golden State Warriors' Larry McNeill in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland. The NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in 1984 at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's Larry Nance defeated the original\n\nSlam Dunk Contest Dunk contest winner Julius Erving in the final round. Dominique Wilkins won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his Atlanta Hawks teammate Spud Webb made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7 inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds. Chicago's Michael Jordan won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988. His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk\n\nBrent Barry duos are Bill Walton and his son Luke Walton, and Mychal Thompson and his son Klay Thompson. In June 2007, he won his second NBA championship ring when the Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0. In January 2008, Barry tore his right calf muscle. On February 20, 2008, (not too long after his injury) Barry, along with Francisco Elson and a 2009 first round draft pick, were traded by the San Antonio Spurs back to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for forward/center Kurt Thomas. Barry was waived the following day by the Sonics. After a mandatory 30-day waiting period, he\n\nBrent Barry re-signed with San Antonio on March 24, 2008 for 1 year with the possibility for the 2009–2010 season at Veteran Minimum. Coming off of injury Barry did not see very much playing time in the first 2 rounds of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. Barry would shine against the Lakers in the Western Conference finals, however, getting 23 points in Game 4, with a controversial no-call foul with 2 seconds on the clock. The Spurs would lose the series in 5 games, however. San Antonio provided Barry with the most playoff experience (71 games) of his career. He totaled 356 3-point\n\nSlam Dunk Contest and Jason Richardson, the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest. In 2005, the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate Steve Nash; J. R. Smith putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, Josh Smith alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules\n\nBrent Barry a backup. After losing their first playoff game to the Denver Nuggets in the 2005 NBA Playoffs, San Antonio inserted Barry into the starting lineup. The Spurs' new lineup helped them beat the Nuggets in the series four games to one. Later in those same playoffs, Barry earned his first championship ring when the Spurs defeated the Detroit Pistons in the 2005 NBA Finals. Brent and his father, Rick Barry, are the second father-son duo to each win an NBA Championship as a player; the first was Matt Guokas, Sr. and his son Matt Guokas, Jr..

Most noticeable being the 2001 contest, in Kaunas, where Robertas\n\nSlam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All-Star Weekend in Oakland, California. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history, featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, his cousin and then-teammate Tracy McGrady, and the Houston Rockets' Steve Francis. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two reverse 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason\n\nDominique Wilkins Michael Jordan in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'7\" teammate, Spud Webb. The 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins' first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins' completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins' head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing\n\nSlam Dunk Contest the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate Gordon Hayward, catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it. Terrence Ross won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former Toronto Raptors player Vince Carter, as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz, Eric Bledsoe of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, Gerald Green of the Indiana Pacers, and James White of the New York Knicks.

His stepmother, Lynn Barry, also was an accomplished basketball player in college. Brent, the second youngest, played his high school basketball at athletic powerhouse De La Salle High School in Concord, California, and graduated in 1990.

With teammate Jameer Nelson's assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away. Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by Jamario Moon while the previous year's winner, Gerald Green, relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed \"The Birthday Cake\"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the\n\nSlam Dunk Contest to allow up-and-coming star Blake Griffin to win and that runner-up JaVale McGee deserved to win. It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower degree of difficulty. Ben Maller of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner.

What made the Slam Dunk contest unique in 2008 was the introduction of the fan vote. While judges (in this particular contest, Karl Malone, Magic Johnson, Julius Erving, Darryl Dawkins and Dominique Wilkins) still scored dunks on a scale from one to fifty and selected those who would move on to the next round, fans had the last word.
